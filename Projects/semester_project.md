# Semester Project 



There are five levels or tiers available for you complete the semester project.  Each tier offers varying levels of complexity and deliverables.  Your chosen tier will guide the expectations for your project, allowing you to decide the level of challenge you wish to undertake.  A semester project of at least Tier 5 is required in order to pass the class. 

Each Project Tier has the same general parts:
1. Pose a question
2. Find data to answer the question
3. Perform an EDA
4. Present your findings

Below are the basic requirements for each part by Project Tier.  See the [Tiers Folder](Tiers/) for more details.

* [Tier 5: Passing](Tiers/semester_project_t5.md)
    * **Bare Minimum**
        1. Pose a question that is interesting to you
        2. Find an already existing public dataset that can be used to answer the question
        3. Perform an EDA
        4. Summarize your methods and results in a report
* [Tier 4: Observer](Tiers/semester_project_t4.md)
    * **Main Differences from Tier 5**
        1. Same as Tier 5
        2. Data should come from *more than one* already existing dataset; dataset size requirements result in a slightly more complicated dataset
        3. A few more visualizations are required for the EDA 
        4. Same as Tier 5
* [Tier 3: Contributor](Tiers/semester_project_t3.md)
    * **Main Differences from Tier 4**
        1. Topic and question are encouraged to be broadly appealing 
        2. Data should be scraped, gathered by querying an API or using a Python API wrapper 
        3. A few more visualizations are required for the EDA 
        4. A dashboard is required along with a report
* [Tier 2: Between Leader and Contributor](Tiers/semester_project_t2.md)
    * **Main Differences from Tier 3**
        1. Same as Tier 3 
        2. Dataset size requirements result in a slightly more complicated dataset; A blog post is required to summarize data collection methods
        3. A blog post is required to summarize the results of the EDA
        4. The final report is not required since the information is encompassed in the two blog posts
* [Tier 1: Leader](Tiers/semester_project_t1.md)
    * **Main Differences from Tier 2**
        1. Same as Tier 2 except Python API wrappers are discouraged
        2. Dataset size requirements result in a slightly more complicated dataset;  Peer feedback and documented improvement resulting from the feedback is required for blog post
        3. Peer feedback and documented improvement resulting from the feedback is required for blog post
        4. Peer feedback and documented improvement resulting from the feedback is required for the dashboard
