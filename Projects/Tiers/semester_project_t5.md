# Semester Project
## Tier 5:
### Part 1: Choose a Topic
* Select a topic that is both personally interesting and broadly appealing.
* Formulate a research question that is not overly trivial.
* Ensure the research question can be explored and answered using data.
* **TASKS:**
    - [ ] Choose a topic and related question.

### Part 2: Data Collection and Cleaning
* In this part you will gather publicly available data to address your question of interest.
* **REQUIREMENTS** 
    - [ ] Find a public dataset that can answer the question you posed in Part 1 
    - [ ] The dataset should comprise **at least**:
        * 150 observations 
        * 4 informative features (an "ID" column is generally not considered informative)
        * One numeric feature
    - [ ] Ensure that the data is comprehensive enough to support an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
* **TASKS**
    - [ ] Find an appropriate dataset
    - [ ] Create a public GitHub repository including:
        * Well-organized and documented Python code for cleaning and data preparation
          * A Readme.md file explaining the repository's purpose and contents.  Include a link to where you found your data in this file.

### Part 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
* In this part you will conduct an initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) of your dataset.
* **REQUIREMENTS**
    - [ ] The EDA should feature 3-5 figures, preferably including various types (e.g., boxplots, scatterplots, maps).
* **TASKS**
    - [ ] Develop a list of 4-5 questions you intend to explore within your dataset.
    - [ ] Create graphs and tables to address these questions.
    - [ ] Add well-documented Python code for your EDA to the GitHub repository.
    - [ ] Select the 3-5 most compelling graphs and tables to discuss in your dashboard and report in Part 4.

 
### Part 4: Present Your Data
* In this part, you will create a brief report highlighting the main results and insights from Parts 2 and 3.  

* **TASKS**
- [ ] Create a Markdown file named `project_summary.md` and include it in the repository along with your code and data.
- [ ] The report should encompass the following sections:
    * **Introduction and Motivation:** Provide an introduction to the project topic and the associated research question. Explain the motivation behind choosing this topic.
    * **Methods:** Summarize where you found your data and the details about what is included in the data.  Include (if possible) details about how the original publisher of the data created the dataset. 
    * **Results:** Summarize the key findings from your Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Highlight the most significant insights gained from your data exploration.
    * **Conclusion:** Summarize the EDA contributed to answering your main research question. Reflect on the project's overall significance.
