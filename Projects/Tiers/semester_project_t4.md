# Semester Project
## Tier 4:
### Part 1: Choose a Topic
* Select a topic that is both personally interesting and broadly appealing.
* Formulate a research question that is original, creative, compelling, and not overly trivial.
* Ensure the research question can be explored and answered using data.
* **TASKS:**
    - [ ] Choose a topic and related question.

### Part 2: Data Collection and Cleaning
* In this part you will gather publicly available data to create an original dataset.
* **REQUIREMENTS** 
    - [ ] Assemble a dataset of **multiple** already existing datasets 
    - [ ] The dataset should comprise **at least**:
        * 200 observations 
        * 5 informative features (an "ID" column is generally not considered informative)
        * One numeric feature
    - [ ] Ensure that the data is comprehensive enough to support detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
* **TASKS**
    - [ ] Compile the dataset according to the specified requirements.
    - [ ] Create a public GitHub repository including:
        * Well-organized and documented Python code cleaning and data preparation
        * The dataset (if privacy concerns exist, consult with me regarding data inclusion in the repository).
        * A Readme.md file explaining the repository's purpose and contents.

### Part 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
* In this part you will conduct an initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) of your dataset.
* **REQUIREMENTS**
    - [ ] The EDA should feature 4-8 figures, including various types (e.g., boxplots, scatterplots, maps).
* **TASKS**
    - [ ] Develop a list of 4-5 questions you intend to explore within your dataset.
    - [ ] Create graphs and tables to address these questions.
    - [ ] Generate new questions and insights as you proceed with the EDA.
    - [ ] Add well-documented Python code for your EDA to the GitHub repository.
    - [ ] Select the 6-10 most compelling graphs and tables to discuss in your report in Part 4.

 
### Part 4: Present Your Data
* In this part, you will create a brief report highlighting the main results and insights from Parts 2 and 3.  

* **TASKS**
- [ ] Create a Markdown file named `project_summary.md` and include it in the repository along with your code and data.
- [ ] The report should encompass the following sections:
    * **Introduction and Motivation:** Provide an introduction to the project topic and the associated research question. Explain the motivation behind choosing this topic.
    * **Methods:** Summarize how you obtained your data, including the ethical considerations involved. Avoid excessive detail but include enough information for a classmate at our level to understand the process and potentially replicate it.
    * **Results:** Summarize the key findings from your Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Highlight the most significant insights gained from your data exploration.
    * **Conclusion:** Summarize how the data collection and EDA contributed to answering your main research question. Reflect on the project's overall significance.
